The history of software development goes way back to 1940s. Software engineers and developers are designing products to address the need for large-scale function business systems back then.
Today, more technologies are created with even higher features, thanks to software development which usually works alongside software engineering. Here is a timeline of the important developments in the history of software:

        The history of software development has proven that innovation stems from a previous innovation. Today, the programming language and operating systems only continue to be enhanced further.
Software development has been supported by different kinds of programming through the years.
